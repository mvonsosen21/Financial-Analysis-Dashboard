RShiny Financial Analysis Dashboard

I have developed a comprehensive financial analysis dashboard within the RShiny framework. This dynamic tool is equipped with synthetic data and pseudonymous account names. The development of this dashboard encompasses a range of sophisticated operations and functionalities, as detailed below:

**1. Data Ingestion and Preparation:**

- The project commenced with the importation of raw data, followed by an intricate process of data cleaning, wrangling, and transformation to ensure its suitability for visualization.

**2. Data Analysis and Visualization:**

The heart of the dashboard lies in its ability to provide rich insights through an array of compelling visualizations for multiple accounts. These insights include:

- Date Range Filtering: Users have the capability to effortlessly filter data for a specific date range via the sidebar, which then dynamically updates all visualizations and value boxes throughout the dashboard.
- Daily Posted Balance Analysis: The dashboard offers a detailed analysis of the daily posted balance for individual accounts, allowing for a meticulous examination of spending patterns. Additionally, it provides an overarching view of the company's financials to track spending habits comprehensively.
- Expenditure Categorization: Leveraging a proprietary categorization scheme, the dashboard showcases where the company allocates its funds most frequently, providing a visual representation of expenditure distribution.
- Frequency of Spend: Building upon the categorization scheme, the dashboard unveils the frequency of expenditure within each category, shedding light on the company's most frequent spending areas.

**3. Value Boxes:**

To enhance user engagement, the dashboard integrates value boxes that convey essential information:

- Average Monthly Spend: Calculated for both individual accounts and aggregated accounts, this metric aids in understanding spending trends over the specified timeframe.
- End-of-Period Account Balance: The dashboard displays the balance in the account(s) at the conclusion of the selected timeframe.

**4. Recurring Expenses Analysis:**

The dashboard also includes a comprehensive analysis of the recurring expenses incurred by the company on a monthly basis. This analysis comprises:

- Monthly Recurring Expense Visualization: Users can explore recurring expenses by category for each month within the specified timeframe, providing valuable insights into expense patterns.
- Total Recurring Expenses Over Time: A visualization tracking the cumulative recurring expenses over the specified timeframe.
- Value Boxes: Two value boxes offer quick access to key recurring expense information:
> - Average Monthly Recurring Spend: Calculated for the selected timeframe, this metric aids in understanding the average monthly commitment to recurring expenses.
> - Number of Monthly Recurring Expenses: This value box succinctly communicates the count of recurring expenses incurred by the company each month.

In summary, this RShiny financial analysis dashboard empowers users to gain valuable financial insights and make data-driven decisions, all while safeguarding data privacy and ensuring a user-friendly experience.
